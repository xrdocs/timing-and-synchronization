Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist --- perhaps you can try searching for it below.

{% include base_path %}

<div value="{{ base_path }}" id="base_url" >
<form action="get" id="site_search">
<center>
  <input style="font-size:20px;" class="searchForm" type="text" id="search_box" placeholder="Try some keywords...">
  <button type="submit" value=" Send" class="btn btn--x-large" id="submit"/>Search
</center>
</form>
<br/>&nbsp;
</div>
<ul class="fa-ul" id="search_results"></ul>

<script src="{{ base_path }}/assets/js/lunr.min.js"></script>
